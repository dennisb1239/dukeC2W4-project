It is harder to interpret than MAE as it's not in base units, however, it is generally more popular.<br>\n**RMSE**: Most popular metric, similar to MSE, however, the result is square rooted to make it more interpretable as it's in base units. It is recommended that RMSE be used as the primary metric to interpret your model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print ('MAE is:', mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions))\nprint ('MSE is:', mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))\nprint ('RMSE is:', sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-10T05:35:04.355491Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-10T05:35:04.355863Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-10T05:35:04.363965Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-10T05:35:04.355835Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-10T05:35:04.36247Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# alpha helps to show overlapping data\nplt.scatter(predictions, y_test, alpha = 0.7, color = 'b')\nplt.xlabel('Predicted Price')\nplt.ylabel('Actual Price')\nplt.title('Linear Regression Model')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-10T05:35:05.995819Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-10T05:35:05.996163Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-10T05:35:06.176656Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-10T05:35:05.996134Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-10T05:35:06.175454Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Submission","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"submission = pd.DataFrame()\nsubmission['Id'] = test['Id'].astype(int)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-03T14:21:08.239824Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-03T14:21:08.240204Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-03T14:21:08.24666Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-03T14:21:08.240163Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-03T14:21:08.245583Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"temp = test.select_dtypes(include = [np.number]).drop(['Id'], axis = 1).interpolate()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-03T14:21:08.594909Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-03T14:21:08.595302Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-03T14:21:08.608945Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-03T14:21:08.595257Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-03T14:21:08.607985Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"predictions = model.predict(temp)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-03T14:21:08.969983Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-03T14:21:08.970395Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-03T14:21:08.984413Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-03T14:21:08.970357Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-03T14:21:08.981866Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"predictions = np.exp(predictions)\nsubmission['SalePrice'] = predictions","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-03T14:21:09.419623Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-03T14:21:09.420264Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-03T14:21:09.427006Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-03T14:21:09.420199Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-03T14:21:09.42605Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index = False)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-03T14:21:12.152048Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-03T14:21:12.152711Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-03T14:21:12.167841Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-03T14:21:12.152656Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-03T14:21:12.166675Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
